## Featured Projects üíª

### [Portorb] ((https://wingbeltcreations.itch.io/portorb))

**Portorb** is my first completed **Game Jam entry** built with **Godot**. This project was my first success in **Godot**, as all my previous projects
never made it past test rooms. Completed in under a week, Portorb is a simple platformer, but was my introduction to **Signals** and great **GDScript** practice.
I intend to return to the project for a "DX" version.
